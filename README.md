# Trello Board

A Trello board project built using Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite, allowing users to manage tasks with ease. The project utilizes Vue 3 for its reactive and composable nature, TypeScript for static typing and improved code maintainability, Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, and Vite for fast development and hot module replacement. With features like drag-and-drop functionality provided by vuedraggable and unique identifiers generated by nanoid, organizing tasks has never been simpler.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js 3
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Vue Draggable
- Nanoid

## Features

- Add, remove, and rearrange tasks with drag-and-drop functionality
- Responsive design for seamless use across devices
- Efficient state management using Vue 3 composition API
- Utilizes nanoid for generating unique task identifiers

## Advantages of Using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

### TypeScript

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, providing benefits such as:

- Enhanced code maintainability and scalability
- Early detection of errors during development
- Improved IDE support and code navigation

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers advantages like:

- Rapid UI development with reusable utility classes
- Consistent and maintainable styling across the project
- Ability to easily customize and extend styles without writing custom CSS

## Code Structure

The project follows a modular structure for better organization and maintainability. Here's a brief overview of the main components:

### `TrelloBoard.vue`

This file represents the main Trello board component, which displays columns and tasks. It makes use of Vue 3 composition API and features draggable columns and tasks. Notable imports include nanoid for generating unique identifiers and vuedraggable for drag-and-drop functionality.

### `TrelloBoardTask.vue`

The `TrelloBoardTask.vue` component represents individual tasks within the Trello board. It receives a task object as a prop and renders the task title. This component also handles deletion of tasks.

### `NewTask.vue`

The `NewTask.vue` component is responsible for adding new tasks to the board. It provides a textarea where users can enter a task title. When the enter key is pressed or the textarea loses focus, the task is added to the corresponding column.

### `DragHandle.vue`

The `DragHandle.vue` component represents the drag handle used to drag and reorder tasks within a column. It's used in both the `TrelloBoard.vue` and `TrelloBoardTask.vue` components.

### TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

The project utilizes TypeScript for static typing and improved code maintainability. Tailwind CSS is used for rapid UI development, providing a utility-first approach to styling.
